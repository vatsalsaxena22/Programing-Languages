# C Language

Known as a foundational language, it's like the bedrock of programming. It's close to the hardware, offering control over memory and system processes. Perfect for performance-critical applications like operating systems or embedded systems.

## Purpose: 
A powerful, low-level language primarily used for system programming, such as developing operating systems, drivers, and embedded systems.

## Performance: 
It's compiled, fast, and provides direct access to hardware and memory, making it ideal for resource-constrained applications.

## Features:

- Procedural (step-by-step execution).

- Rich set of operators and a small set of keywords.

- Excellent for learning programming fundamentals as it's close to how the computer actually works.

## Use Cases: 
Operating systems (e.g., Linux), compilers, and performance-critical applications.
